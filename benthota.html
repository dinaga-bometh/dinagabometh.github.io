      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        The Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a conservation project dedicated to protecting and preserving sea turtles in
        Bentota, Sri Lanka. We aim to raise awareness about the threats faced by these majestic creatures and provide a
        safe environment for their nesting and hatching.

      <h2>Turtle Conservation</h2>
      <p>
        Our hatchery plays a vital role in the conservation of sea turtles by collecting and incubating eggs. Once the
        hatchlings are ready, we release them into the ocean, increasing their chances of survival. Visitors can witness
        this incredible process and learn more about the different species of sea turtles found in the area.
