    <h2>Preserving Turtle Species for Future Generations</h2>
    <p>Preserving turtles for the future is crucial for the preservation of biodiversity and the health of our marine ecosystems. Measures such as protecting nesting sites from disturbance, implementing turtle-friendly fishing practices, conserving critical habitats, combating pollution, and promoting education and awareness are vital. By safeguarding turtles, we contribute to the overall resilience of ecosystems, maintain essential ecological functions, and ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures for future generations. Through concerted efforts, we can create a sustainable future where turtles thrive, providing inspiration, balance, and a living testament to the beauty and importance of our natural world.</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is a conservation project dedicated to protecting and preserving sea turtles.

    <h1>Hatchery Programs</h1>
    <p>
     <h2>Nest Protection</h2>
  <p>Locals and volunteers patrol the beach to identify and protect turtle nests from poaching and other threats. The nests are carefully monitored until the hatchlings emerge.</p>
  
  <h2>Hatchling Care</h2>
  <p>Upon hatching, the baby turtles are collected and placed in specially designed tanks for their initial care and protection. This stage ensures that the hatchlings are strong and healthy before their release into the ocean.</p>
  
  <h2>Rehabilitation of Injured Turtles</h2>
  <p>The hatchery provides a sanctuary for injured or sick turtles, offering medical treatment and rehabilitation. Once recovered, they are released back into the wild.</p>
  
  <h2>Educational Programs</h2>
  <p>The hatchery conducts educational programs for visitors, raising awareness about the importance of turtle conservation and the challenges they face.</p>
