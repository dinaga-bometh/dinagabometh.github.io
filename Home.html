				<h2>About Turtles</h2>
				<br>

				<p class="first-paragraph"> 
				Turtles are captivating reptiles with a distinctive bony shell that shields their body. They come in a range of sizes, from small palm-sized species to large marine turtles. With their webbed feet or flippers, they navigate through various habitats, including oceans, rivers, and deserts. Their color patterns often provide camouflage. Turtles possess a remarkable longevity, with some species living for over a century. They are primarily herbivorous but may also consume insects and small aquatic creatures. Female turtles lay eggs on land, burying them in sandy nests for incubation. Turtles play a crucial role in ecosystems, maintaining balance and serving as a source of food.
